# üåç Spatial Data Analysis: Tam Dao National Park, Vietnam

This repository contains all the materials used in a practical spatial data analysis project based on Tam Dao National Park in Vietnam. The project demonstrates how to analyze real-world spatial data using QGIS. 

üìå Project Overview

The aim of this project is to introduce foundational spatial data concepts and walk through the full workflow of analyzing spatial data for conservation-related applications. This includes working with both raster and vector data, understanding data types, and performing meaningful analysis using real datasets.

üîç What We Analyzed

- Using spatial data from Tam Dao National Park, this project explores:
- Land use patterns and classifications
- Elevation and terrain modeling
- Buffer analysis and distance calculations
- Habitat suitability modeling
- Visualization of spatial data for communication

‚öôÔ∏è How the Analysis Was Done

The analysis followed a practical workflow:
1. Data Acquisition
- Downloaded openly available spatial datasets, including satellite imagery, park boundaries, elevation models, and species presence data.
2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Reprojected spatial layers to a common coordinate system.
- Cropped raster layers to the park extent.
- Cleaned and validated vector geometries.
3. Spatial Analysis
- In QGIS, we conducted buffer zones around ranger stations, clipped datasets to study areas, and visualized elevation gradients.
4. Interpretation & Visualization
- Produced visual maps and statistical summaries to interpret findings.
- Generated plots of elevation vs. species presence and identified potential conservation areas.
